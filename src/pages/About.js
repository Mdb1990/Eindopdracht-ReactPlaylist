        it's been a while since i worked on the fullstack development
        assignments, this is because my work is taking alot of time. I added
        some other things to the app such as a localStorage so that when you go
        refresh the page or go to the other page the list persists. Im eager to
        go on and finish what i started, im going all in now again and hope to
        make it to the finish line.
      </p>
    </div>
